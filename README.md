# What's this?
This is a website I have built from the ground up when I first started learning HTML/CSS/Javascript. I had no previous experience in web programming and I decided I would learn by doing. I ended up starting to work on a bike shop website. VÃ©lomane is actually a bike shop I worked at at that moment. I didn't use any framework for this and I borrowed very few stuff from the internet.  

# What I haven't done myself
I used the [SweetAlert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/) library for the stylish alerts throughout my website.  
I've also borrowed the hover effect animation I use in the product sections from Mary Lou on [Codrops.net](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/06/19/ideas-for-subtle-hover-effects/).  
The slideshow on the homepage was taken from [ResponsiveSlides](http://responsiveslides.com/).  
Other than that, it's all me!

# Overview
I did not actually finish the website. The pages I left blank simply would not bring something new to explore so I focused on pages in which I could try new designs. Here's the interesting ones:

### Homepage
Classic homepage with an automatic slideshow without controls.

### All products page
I discovered nice hover effects I could use here.

### All bikes page
On the far right side you can notice a quick-nav section. It is fixed on the page so it's always there and brings you to the relevant sections.

### Bike overview
Here I worked hard on the design itself. The layout is more advanced than on the other pages and the result is far better in my opinion.

### Tune ups

### Contact us
In this section I explored Javascript to show/hide different fields when you choose which kind of feedback you want to prodive (Question, bug report or simple feedback).

### Feedback
On this page I played with PHP as I implemented form validation and sending emails for feedback or questions.
