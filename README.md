# What's this?
This is a website I have built from the ground up when I first started learning HTML/CSS/Javascript. I had no previous experience in web programming and I decided I would learn by doing. I ended up starting to work on a bike shop website. VÃ©lomane is actually a bike shop I worked at at that moment. I didn't use any framework for this and I borrowed very few stuff from the internet.  

# What I haven't done myself
I used the [SweetAlert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/) library for the stylish alerts throughout my website.  
I've also borrowed the hover effect animation I use in the product sections from Mary Lou on [Codrops.net](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/06/19/ideas-for-subtle-hover-effects/).  
Other than that, it's all me!

# Overview
I did not actually finish the website. The pages I left blank simply would not bring something new to explore so I focused on pages in which I could try new designs. Here's the interesting ones:

### Homepage
### All products page
### All bikes page
### Bike overview
### Contact us
